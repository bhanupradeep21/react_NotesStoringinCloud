ERROR WHEN TRYING TO MAKE A REQUEST FROM FRONTEND TO BANKEND API CALL :
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The error you're seeing is due to the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy, which is a security feature implemented by browsers to prevent requests to different origins (domains, protocols, or ports) unless they're explicitly allowed by the server.

Here's what's happening:

Your frontend application running on http://localhost:3000 is trying to make a request to your backend API on http://localhost:5000.
The browser checks for CORS headers in the response from the backend.
Since the response doesn't include the necessary CORS headers allowing the request, the browser blocks the request.
